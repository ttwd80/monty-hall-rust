I watched this https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cXqDIFUB7YU

After watching it and listening to the explanation, I still did not fully understand it.

It took a while but now I understand it.

Step 1: Three doors. Two are bad. One is good.

Step 2: Pick a door. Chances of picking a good one is 33.33%. Chances of getting a bad door is 66.67%.

Step 3: One of the bad doors is taken out. Leaving one good door and one bad door.
